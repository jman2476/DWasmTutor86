# Assembly Tutorial 
Original TUTOR86 program by btketman
Running through the DOS Wasm X project by neilb

## Goals:
Single page web application with a minimal infobar at top 10% of the page and the TUTOR86 program running smoothly and responsefully. The user will be able to see the program taking up the other 90% of the screen.

- Front-end only application, without an additional server
- Strip down DOS WASM X to only include basic emulator functions
- Loading the page should feel seemless

## TODOs:

- try and build DWX on my own to understand how that works
- get the front end running on my computer
- cut the js code down until it stops working
- add enough back so it functions again
- repeat with the C code????
- figure out how to get DOS to immediately boot into TUTOR86
- figure out how to get the page to run from github pages
